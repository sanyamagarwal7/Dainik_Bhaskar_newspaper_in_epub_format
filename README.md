# Dainik_Bhaskar_newspaper_in_epub_format

[Dainik Bhaskar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dainik_Bhaskar) is a daily hindi newspaper. This is a repository that compiles all articles within the past two days from the newspaper into an .epub file which is accessible in most e-readers.

**Motivation**
My primary motivation was to improve my hindi vocabulary. One way to accomplish this is to read hindi newspapers daily. However, I faced a couple of issues in this regard. Hindi newspapers generally don't have e-reader friendly versions, and there's only print versions or online versions. While print versions are great, they have the issue that you constantly look up a dictionary with you to translate some words, which is both cumbersome and not conducive to free-flowing reading. For online versions too, translating can be a pain because typing Hindi in English keyboards is often painful. Further, I didn't want to sit in front of a screen first thing in the morning while reading the newspaper.
However, having a epub format allows me to read the newspaper on Kindle, avoiding eye-glare as well as easy use Kindle's hindi-to-english dictionaries circumventing both issues to a large extent.

**Acknowledgements**
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is a brilliant tool created by Kovid Goyal, which allows you to scrape hundreds of newspapers easily. It is able to scrape this newspaper too, but the scraped version only had access to the first few lines of each article. Hence, I wrote up this code to solve this issue.

**Future work**
<li>Adding section wise crosslinking from table of contents, instead of one collated file.</li>
<li>Creating an application that can directly send the generated file to a specified Kindle address with one tap. Presently, we need to manually send the generated epub to Kindle.
</li>
